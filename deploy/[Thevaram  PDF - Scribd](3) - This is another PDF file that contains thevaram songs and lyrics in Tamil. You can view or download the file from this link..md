Thevaram is a collection of devotional poems sung by three Tamil saints, Sambandar, Appar and Sundarar, in praise of Lord Shiva. These poems are considered to be one of the most important sources of Tamil bhakti literature and culture. They express the intense love and devotion of the saints towards Shiva, who is seen as the supreme reality, the compassionate protector and the liberator of souls.
 
The word Thevaram means "garland of songs" or "divine songs". It is derived from the Tamil words "the" (god) and "varam" (song). Thevaram is also the name of the musical genre in which these poems are sung. Thevaram songs are composed in a unique musical style that predates most Indian classical music systems. They are based on ancient Tamil scales and rhythms, and are sung with simple instruments such as cymbals, drums and flutes.

Thevaram songs are classified into seven volumes, called Tirumurais. The first three Tirumurais contain the songs of Sambandar, the fourth to sixth Tirumurais contain the songs of Appar, and the seventh Tirumurai contains the songs of Sundarar. The eighth Tirumurai is a compilation of various other songs by different authors. The ninth Tirumurai is the Tiruvasagam, a collection of poems by Manikkavasagar, another Tamil saint. The tenth to twelfth Tirumurais are also compilations of various other works by different authors.
 
Thevaram songs are rich in poetic imagery, symbolism and metaphors. They describe the various aspects and forms of Shiva, his attributes, his actions, his abodes and his devotees. They also narrate the personal experiences and stories of the saints, their struggles, their miracles and their bliss. They convey a profound sense of gratitude, surrender and joy towards Shiva.
 
Thevaram songs are not only meant to be sung, but also to be understood and meditated upon. They reveal the essence of Shaivism, the philosophy and practice of worshipping Shiva as the supreme reality. They teach the seekers how to attain liberation from the cycle of birth and death by realizing their true identity as Shiva himself.
 
Thevaram songs are still sung today by devotees in temples, festivals and homes. They are also studied by scholars and enthusiasts as a valuable source of Tamil language, literature, history, culture and spirituality. They are considered to be a treasure of Tamil heritage and a gift to humanity.
